# _C. Elegans_ Network Connectivity and Correlated Gene Expression

This repository provides the code for reproducing a range of analyses involving processing connectivity and gene expression data for *C. elegans*, and running a range of analyses to relate patterns in both measurements.

Please read our paper, and if you use this code, please cite our paper:

### Data files
Data files required for this project are hosted on [this figshare repository](https://figshare.com/s/797199619fbabdab8c86).
Please download data from this repository and place into the **Data** directory.

### Data processing
After retrieving data, data files needed for analysis can be generated by running:
```matlab
RegenerateData;
```

### Analysis
Figures in our paper can be regenerated using functions in the **FigureGenerators** directory.
Other relevant analysis scripts are in **Analysis**.
Run `LoadAllData` to add all required paths and load necessary gene expression and connectivity data (stored in `G` and `C` data structures, respectively).
